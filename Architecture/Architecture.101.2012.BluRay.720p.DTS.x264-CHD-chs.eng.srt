If you don't change the design

427

So, aren't you dating?

00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,820
Want me to introduce someone?

429
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,777

433
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,947
Think of 10 pretty girls

434
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,790

You two are so alike

438
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,628
Hold on

439
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,221
Yes, Chief

440
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,680
I asked Sung to hand the blueprints over

441
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,688
Eun-chae? Do you have a boyfriend?

442
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,273
I'm getting married

443
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,485
Really? When?

444
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,368
End of the year or early next year

445
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,865
Congratulations!

446
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,993
We decided recently

447
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,123
We're going to the States

448
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:38,298
I'll go study and hell work there

449
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,004
He's really lucky
to have a pretty girl like you

450
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,383
Isn't he?

451

452
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,513
- Just talking about you
- About me?

453
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,439
That you're lucky

454
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,813
It's me, The pretty and nice girl

455
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,148
I said that?

456
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,864
What?

457
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,288
You two are together?

458
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,249
I didn't know

459
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,290
Why you! With a pretty girl like this

460
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,461
So sneaky

461
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,503
No one at work knows

462
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,084
It's a secret

463
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,673
But I thought you should know

464
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,684
I heard he met his first love in college

465
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,686
Do you know her?

466
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,688
I'm curious, but he won't tell

467
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,611
It was in his 1st year

468
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,824
Who is it? Someone I know?

469
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,777
O

470
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,781
Who is it? I'm curious

471
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,125
Tell us, You said she's a bitch

472
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,054
A tie in a place like this?

473
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,893
It's not for here

474
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,018
You can wear it when you go back home

475
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,691
It suits you well

476
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,270
Now, it looks like a house

477
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,284
Dad?

478
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,704
Why'd you start renovations

479
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,623
cuz of me?

480
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:37,784
Who said that?

481
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,416
I met our old neighbor

482
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,122
She told me

483
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,003
When I die

484
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,589
you could come down and live there

485
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,219
Then, there should be space
for a piano

486
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,644
Piano?

487
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,642
You struggled so much without a piano

488
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,474
when you were young

489
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,859
I don't play it anymore

490
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,608
Why waste your talent?

491
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,816
Let's just drop it

492
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,571
So, it's a bachelor?

493
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,873
How can we live, eat
and sleep in one room?

494
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,700
That's our first home?

495
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,498
My aunt says

496
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,501
East Village is a great place to live

497
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,253
It's close to my school, too

498
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:29,298
Come on, we talked about this

499
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,305
That's all I can do for now

500
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,802
It'll be hard at first, but

501
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,431
Daddy said hed help us out

502
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,931
Don't be so sensitive

503
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,642
Can't you think it over?

504
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,084
I give up!

505
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,877
Jae-wook's so lucky

506
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,675
I can come up with
great designs living here

507
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,383
Retard

508
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,888
A house, a car
all you need is a girl

509
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,559
Is this your new computer?

510
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,483
It's a Pentium with 1GB hard drive

511
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,322
1GB?

512
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,025
1,000 mega bites?

513
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,032
You can't use all that in your whole life

514
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,327
What's this?

515
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,617
Hey!

516
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,754
It's easy

517
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,548
Make a girl drink beer and get her drunk

518
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,715
Then what?

519
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,255
Then

520
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,178
you carry her and put her on a bed. That's it

521
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,224
- So, the stockings are...
- Hey!

522
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,642
Just eat your noodles

523
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,560
Is your club fun?

524
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,198
- Why?
- Just curious

525
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,824
You know Seo-yeun? She's in it, too

526
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,413
Who?

527
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:26,120
The music major in Architecture 101

528
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,706
That girl? She's pretty

529
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:35,053
Really? I didn't notice

530
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,551
She's not bad

531
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,632
When girls like her

532
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,014
start wearing makeup in second year

533
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,762
they get really pretty

534
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,348
You don't know shit

535
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:56,029
Is her boyfriend in the club, too?

536
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,734
The stockings are hers?

537
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,946
- Hey!
- What?

538
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,576
Don't eat all the radish you pig

539
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,910
HEY

540
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,003
Why're you here?

541
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,430
I forgot my keys

542
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,136
Look in my bag

543
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,220
Okay, thanks

544
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,149
Did you eat? Have some soup

545
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,567
OKHY

546
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,313
Come on

547
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,940
Just lend it to me for a few days

548
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,776
Go back to your store!

549
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:40,527
Come on

550
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,614
- Going straight home?
- Yeah

551
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,540
- You're all grown up
- Bye

552
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,243
Go on home

553
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:52,547
- Come on
- I said, no!

554
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,124
Seung-min!

555
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,260
- On your way home?
- Yeah

556
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,963
What are you doing here?

557
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,048
Came to get something

558
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,017
- It's heavy
- Right

559
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,271
- Did you eat?
- Yeah

560
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,607
I mean, not yet

561
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,026
Great, I hate eating alone

562
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:13,943
PORK SOUP

563
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,733
Just go! I can't!

564
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,156
Do you like pork soup?

565
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,328
What guy can't eat pork soup?

566
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,038
Such a city boy

567
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,869
I just don't like it much,
that's all

568
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,707
Tada!

569
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,334
I cleaned it over the weekend

570
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,836
Mopped it and everything

571
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,637
It's my house now

572
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,134
I even planted flowers

573
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,061
In the fall? What flowers?

574
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,354
Curious?

575
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,353
I'm not telling

576
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:09,784
I went to Jae-wooks house recently

577
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,203
It was really nice

578
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,712
Have you been there?

579
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,216
No. Why would I?

580
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,394
He said

581
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,314
you're really popular in the club

582
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,692
Of course!

583
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,024
Then...

584
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,612
you must have a boyfriend

585
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,032
Nope

586
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:56,622
- Go bring some soil
- Sure

587
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,175
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

588
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,670
What about you?

589
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,014
Well, no

590
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,299
See? You, too

591
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,311
Jae-wook is the most popular

592
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,107
All the girls in our club
have a crush on him

593
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,769
WhY's he so popular?

594
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,571
He's good looking and tall

595
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,115
He's rich

596
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,992
And he majors in architecture

597
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,654
I think that's cool

598
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,907
I'm in architecture

599
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,835
Oh, right

600
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,209
Just saying

601
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,722
Do you like Jae-wook, too?

602
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,641
Is that why youre taking our class?

603
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,646
Can't I like him?

604
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,073
Still

605
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,364
he doesn't have any interest in me

606
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,202
I have no chance

607
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,722
Learned to drink in college?

608
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,517
How's your girlfriend?

609
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,312
Flurry? She's fine

610
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,890
Flurry? That's her name?

611
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,393
Two pretty girls keep my mind off studying

612
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,737
So, I call em Flurry and Faze

613
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,156
Wanna meet Faze?

614
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,859
No high school girls for me

615
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,865
But Faze is in grade 9

616
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:04,082
- I know this person
- A girl?

617
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,586
No, a QUY

618
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:14,468
Somehow he met this girl and

619
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,597
Slept with her?

620
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,808
No, got close with her

621
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:25,404
They got close really fast

622
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,027
They do homework together

623
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,609
and talk about their family

624
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,945
Then

625
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:41,537
Why do you think they got close?

626
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,045
The hell are you saying?

627
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,218
Well, I mean

628
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,884
this guy and a girl

629
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,132
were complete strangers

630
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,717
It's you, right?

631
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,636
O

632
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,142
it's a guy I know at school

633
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,224
Screw you, man!

634
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,186
You don't know shit how to lie

635
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,398
So, who's the girl?

636
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,318
Just eat, pal

637
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:25,622
Yang Seo-yeun?

638
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:29,130
It's a nice, pretty name

639
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,520
First, buy a bottle of Soju

640
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,855
Then, go to her house

641
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,809
Open the bottle, then call her

642
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,441
When she picks up say I'm right outside,

643
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,021
then hang up

644
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,190
Hang UP?

645
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,817
Just hang up

646
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,539
Then shell get really curious

647
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,740
Why's he here?

648
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,746
Then, shell come out

649
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:07,797
But you reek of Soju

650
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,466
Shell get scared at first

651
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,302
It's totally baffling, right?

652
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,382
He shows up suddenly
and reeks like liquor?

653
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,133
Then, you go up close

654
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,389
Go up close?

655
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,012
Real close!

656
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,221
Then, shell be scared

657
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,228
and slowly back up

658
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,230
Then, shell go against the wall

659
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,609
Then, you hit the wall
with your right hand!

660
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,948
Shell get totally scared

661
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,445
What are you doing?

662
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,618
Then the surprise!

663
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,827
You don't say a word and walk off

664
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:42,782
Don't look back

665
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,329
The key is your back

666
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,333
It has to look somehow sad

667
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:53,339
Don't say anything? Thats it?

668
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,264
Too connotative?

669
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,262
Then

670
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,843
just say one thing

671
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,389
Say, I want you

672
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,225
'Let's live together!'

673
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:17,651
But how? I don't have a house

674
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,951
Stupid. You don't live
together for real

675
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:26,159
You just say it, fool

676
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,636
Thanks, Baffle. You're all I got

677
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,219
Why you little

678
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:50,275
Liking girls now.
You're all grown up, man

679
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,146
Seo-yeun is dang cute

680
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,277
- Damn pretty!
- Okay, man

681
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,283
- Seo-yeun!
- Shut up, fool!

682
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,113
Seo-yeun!

683
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,826
It's embarrassing, man!

684
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,285
Seo-yeun!

685
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:18,763
Stop! Quiet!

686
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,221
Seo-yeun!

687
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,685
This isn't what I had in mind

688
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,228
You can't tell now

689
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,231
I can't tell from the blueprints

690
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,311
Don't need to

691
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,237
Everythings like you wanted

692
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,024
But

693
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,612
The room is smaller than I thought

694
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,363
This is big

695
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,824
It's 3,600 wider here

696
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,372
with folding windows here

697
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,327
The sofa goes here

698
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:51,953
The kitchens back there

699
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,879
I don't know what 3,600 means

700
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,877
and the windows seem small

701
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,583
Can't you take it out more?

702
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,384
Then you'll go into the sea!

703
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,803
Look

704
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,255
I left the roof, but raised

705
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,428
the ceiling 600 more

706
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,384
So, it'll look bigger

707
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,603
with the higher ceiling here

708
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,937
You saw it

709
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,562
What now?

710
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,106
You said it was okay already!

711
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,108
We can't change it!

712
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,447
Relax

713
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,117
It's good. I like it

714
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,323
- You said it
- I did not

715
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,909
- You did
- No, I didn't

716
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,538
- You really did
- No, I didn't

717
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:36,339
You asked me to meet you
when it first snowed that year

718
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,508
No way I'd say something so childish

719
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,046
I don't believe this!

720
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,049
I should've recorded it

721
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,549
Hold on a sec

722
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,478
It looked so big when I was young

723
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,484
But it's so small now

724
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,907
Everything looks small to you today?

725
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,325
Growing these days?

726
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,495
By the WHY

727
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,497
I'm curious

728
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,917
So curious today, too

729
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,209
Guess you are growing

730
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,915
You never lose, do you?

731
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,135
Fine. What are you curious about?

732
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,551
Is the bitch me?

733
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,432
What?

734
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,640
Your first love Is the bitch me?

735
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,434
It's not you

736
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,646
Like we had anything

737
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,149
Right. I thought so

738
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,236
But why do I feel like it's me? The bitch

739
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,737
It's weird

740
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,239
Why's it you?

741
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,913
You have a weird sense of humor

742
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,422
No, Mom

743
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,465
That's Eun-chaes opinion

744
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,096
Don't have to worry about it, Mom

745
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,179
I'm busy now

746
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,682
Everyone in the markets doing it

747
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,106
They're gonna tear it down

748
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,683
Just do whatever you want!

749
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,314
Sell your shop or not!

750
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,610
I gotta go

751
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:28,572
How can you talk to your mom like that?

752
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,286
They're redeveloping the area
around her shop

753
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,531
It's complicated. So annoying!

754
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,116
When you go to the States

755
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,043
she'll live there by herself?

756
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:39,836
I guess

757
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,334
What if she gets sick?

758
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,214
You should take care of her

759
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,133
I don't have a choice

760
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,725
That's why sons are no use

761
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,928
Treating your mom like that

762
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,063
What should I do?

763
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,939
Live there forever with her?

764
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,690
Grow old together and die?

765
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,989
I'm just worried, that's all

766
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,691
Why should you be?

767
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,653
Just visit her often
so she doesn't get lonely

768
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,780
Think I'm going somewhere to play?

769
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:18,497
With rent and everything
I'll hardly get by

770
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,876
Okay, I get it

771
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,498
What do you know?

772
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,380
You have a lot of money, time

773
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:30,130
and live alone, so you can say that

774
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,433
How'd you know?

775
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,554
That I live alone

776
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,725
I meant...

777
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,320
Just go without me

778
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,150
- Wait! Come on
- Stop!

779
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,822
It's cuz I'm damn embarrassed

780
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,933
Are you mad?

781
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,511
You and your sense of things

782
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,308
How'd you know that I live alone?

783
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,938
Cuz you never once mentioned
your husband in the designing

784
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:33,697
So, I figured you live alone

785
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,616
Guess it was kinda obvious

786
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,548
But I didn't lie from the start

787
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,297
We were separated

788
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,636
I got divorced last month

789
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,633
I held out as long as I could

790
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,468
For what?

791
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,263
I need the money

792
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,901
My lawyer said

793
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,819
I could get more the longer I held out

794
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,325
Thanks to that
I could build the house

795
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,622
I'm shameless, right?

796
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,415
A real bitch, right?

797
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,002
But I have no choice

798
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,631
It's how the world turns

799
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,633
That's life

800
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,716
Here's the Spicy Soup

801
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,851
Enjoy your meal

802
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,814
Spicy Soup

803
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,653
Isn't it a weird name?

804
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,819
If there's pork, it's Pork Soup

805
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,159
If there's beef, it's Beef Soup

806
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:01,284
But this is just called Spicy Soup

807
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,990
That's it

808
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,836
No matter what's in here

809
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,706
I don't like it

810
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,134
Then, we should've ordered Fish Soup

811
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,090
It's just

812
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,723
My life seems like Spicy Soup

813
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,812
Don't know whats in it

814
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,440
It's just spicy

815
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,745
Everything okay at work?

816
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,131
Something came up here

817
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,093
I'll go up on the first plane tomorrow

818
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,887
Another bottle, please!

819
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,391
Yeah, she's with me

820
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,218
It's nothing

821
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,855
Okay, BYE

822
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,192
You've had enough

823
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,814
Cancel the Soju, please

824
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,817
No, I want another bottle. You go!

825
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,319
You drank enough, Get up

826
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,071
Okay!

827
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,320
That's enough for today

828
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,787
Are you okay? Get up

829
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,252
Stand up

830
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,546
Why drink so much!

831
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,048
It's okay.

832
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,127
Rubbing alcohol will heal it fast

833
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,181
Stupid

834
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,769
Bastard

835
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,689
Me?

836
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,191
Shit! Everything's fucked!

837
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,075
Shit! Everything's fucked!

838
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,496
Shit! Everything's fucked!

839
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,621
Shit! Everything's fucked!

840
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:44,490
This weeks assignment is
Where I want to live

841
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,072
Go someplace nice and have fun

842
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,283
Enjoy the weather

843
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:12,726
- Hey! Why hit so much?
- Don't know!

844
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,936
It's so nice

845
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,447
Today's my birthday

846
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,742
- Today?
' Yup, today

847
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:31,870
November 11th. Remember

848
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:37,581
Shouldn't you be having
a party with friends?

849
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,381
Aren't you my friend?

850
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,170
Let's have a party together

851
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,184
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

852
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:13,332
What do you think
we'll be doing in 10 years?

853
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:18,166
I'll be an architect and you'll be a pianist

854
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,872
I'm not playing piano

855
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,172
Why?

856
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:26,296
I'm sick and tired of it

857
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,384
Know what the others call me?

858
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,855
Jeju-do piano school girl

859
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,024
What's that?

860
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,271
Seoul kids had private tutoring

861
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,233
I'm an insult to them

862
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,576
Only my dad's proud of me

863
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:54,073
What will you do then?

864
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,124
Become an announcer

865
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,170
I'll be a radio DJ, make money,

866
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,164
and become famous!

867
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,041
Announcers make a lot?

868
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,546
Don't they?

869
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,470
At least I can get married to someone rich

870
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,050
Then, I'll build a big house
in a place like this

871
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,684
You build it for free, okay?

872
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,899
Free?

873
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,269
Cheapskate

874
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,862
Here's the down payment

875
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,284
Happy?

876
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,867
I wanna live in a house like this

877
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,286
It'll have 2 floors

878
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,216
With lots of windows and a big yard

879
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,302
Is that too big?

880
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,475
This is the living room

881
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,515
This is the master bedroom

882
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,105
And I'll have two kids

883
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:04,435
So, the kids rooms go
on the second floor

884
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,905
And I'm going to raise a dog.
A huge one!

885
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,447
Woof! Woof!

886
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,865
And a big front entrance

887
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,015
I gotta pee

888
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:14,601
There's no bathroom

889
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,458
You keep watch

890
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,461
Stand far away

891
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,964
But not too far!

892
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,317
A kiss?

893
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,818
That's what you call a kiss?

894
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,827
This is a real kiss

895
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,623
Look

896
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,045
Your lips come together

897
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,341
Then, her lips and yours naturally come in

898
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:18,637
They slither in like snakes

899
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,965
They touch

900
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,970
Naturally, they get like this

901
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,430
They mix

902
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,558
They become one

903
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:37,273
They rub against each other
like fuckin crazy!

904
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,949
They go back and forth
and rap around like crazy!

905
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:44,412
Rub! Ecstasy!

906
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,202
That's a kiss!

907
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,879
What you did is just a peck.
Like you peck yo mama!

908
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,079
Stupid

909
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,881
And to a girl whos sleeping?

910
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,880
That's a crime, man

911
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,879
I'm beat

912
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,563
We played,
walking on railway tracks

913
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,438
What's that?

914
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,145
Don't know?

915
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,148
Whoever falls off
the tracks first loses

916
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
That's so lame

917
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,064
Listen

918
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,486
She says the winner
hits the loser's wrist

919
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,869
You don't hit wrists
unless you're close right?

920
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:33,499
You have to hold hands. Right?

921
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,707
What else?
Punch each others face?

922
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,012
He//0, campus

923
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,266
Fall is nearly over

924
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,273
I recently planted ﬂowers
in the yard

925
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,986
A friend asked what flowers I planted

926
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,828
But I didn't tell what they were

927
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,780
It'll be another reason

928
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,785
to wait and look forward to spring

929
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:15,833
Todays last song is
by Jean Ram-whe

930
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,539
'Etude of Memory'

931
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,890
Did you hear me on the air?

932
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,436
I did

933
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:37,859
How was it?

934
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,814
Your voice sounded great

935
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:42,860
HEY

936
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,366
What are you doing here?

937
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,078
The bus would've been fine

938
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,580
It's okay

939
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,503
seniors can drive juniors home

940
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,009
He's sleeping so comfortably

941
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:09,217
Are you close with him?

942
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,936
Well, a little

943
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,855
Then, good luck with him

944
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,776
No way. We're not like that

945
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,025
Look at his shirt

946
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,365
GUESS starts with G,U,E

947
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,033
The spellings wrong

948
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,031
That's so fake

949
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,329
Oh, it is!

950
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:35,250
G, E, U...

951
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,920
Jae-wook?

952
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,415
How much is the place you live in?

953
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,462
Why? Thinking of moving?

954
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,966
Yes, my dad told me to look into it

955
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,388
Really?

956
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,888
Another member to the Ritz then?

957
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,684
The Ritz? What's that?

958
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,105
Nickname for the most
expensive area of Seoul

959
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:06,148
Come by my apartment to
look around and stuff

960
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,108
I'll buy you drinks

961
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,236
Really? Can I come over?

962
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,947
Of course, anytime

963
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,873
When do you wanna come?

964
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,545
Anytime you're available

965
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,840
- I'll get off here
- What?

966
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,419
- Take care. See ya
- Hey!

967
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:32,341
What's with him running off like that?

968
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:40,227
So? How about this weekend?

969
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,976
Sure, anytime

970
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,690
Saturday's good

971
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,835
You're home?

972
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,255
Where'd I put the Aspirin?
My head kills

973
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,560
What are you doing!

974
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,936
What's with you today?

975
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:32,071
Can't we move, Mom?

976
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,527
Move?

977
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:39,033
To like an apartment in the Ritz area?

978
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:44,289
What the hell are you talking about!

979
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,301
You earn the money and move if you want

980
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,172
Throw that shirt out!

981
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,470
Why! It's fine!

982
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:00,687
Why you! Got money
coming out of your ears?

983
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:04,103
When I only sold $20 worth today!

984
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:07,311
Okay, okay!

985
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,897
Can't you stop saying that?

986
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,696
$20! Again?

987
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,943
Man

988
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,030
Why that little!

989
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,120
Damn kid

990
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,666
Just break it why don't you!

991
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:29,466
He must be out of his mind!

992
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,387
There's only one thing left to do

993
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,508
Just tell her

994
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,888
HQW?

995
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:53,615
Ask her to meet on the first day of snow

996
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,780
That's saying I like her?

997
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,499
She could think it doesn't mean anything

998
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:07,420
What women would think that?

999
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,418
Then, shed be a bear

1000
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:12,421
If so, it won't be worth dating the bitch

1001
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:15,720
Who're you calling bitch?

1002
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,347
Forget it, man

1003
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,934
I'm teaching aesthetics to a guy
who can't even do factoring

1004
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,137
Forget it, man!

1005
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,146
Fine!

1006
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,147
I give UP

1007
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,856
What! You didn't even do anything!

1008
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:38,284
I just want Seo-yeun to be happy

1009
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,576
That's it

1010
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,371
Hal9I9Y? Happiness?

1011
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:45,496
What the hell?

1012
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:48,119
Wait

1013
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:52,252
are there 2 Ps or 1 in happiness?
Can't be 3

1014
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,708
Give me one

1015
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,927
No way, man. This is for adults

1016
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,545
Give me one!

1017
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,973
Try asking nicely, man!

1018
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,305
Here

1019
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,728
Take a drag, then blow

1020
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,312
A drag?

1021
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:18,741
Suck in the smoke, then gulp it down!

1022
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:25,741
What the hell?

1023
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,664
Damn

1024
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,964
My precious smoke!

1025
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,136
Is it heavy?

1026
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:42,261
No, I like lifting heavy things

1027
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,554
We're almost there

1028
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,557
That's my place

1029
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,350
Be honored

1030
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,185
You're the first guest to my house

1031
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,996
Are you happy to move here?

1032
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,340
Of course. It's my own place

1033
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,255
And it's in the Ritz as they say

1034
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,763
Wanna see pics?

1035
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,433
Look!

1036
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,725
I grew a lot

1037
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:38,855
This my dad

1038
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,865
This is me

1039
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,658
This is my house in Jeju-do

1040
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,859
- This?
- Yeah

1041
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,498
See? I'm the tallest

1042
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,160
I used to play a lot with these friends

1043
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,884
I can go back by myself

1044
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,302
It's okay

1045
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,096
I'll walk you to the bus stop

1046
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,591
You don't know your way around
You don't know this area

1047
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,141
Now, we can't take
the same bus anymore

1048
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,643
Complete opposite ends

1049
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:17,564
I kinda got attached to that neighborhood

1050
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:27,534
What are you doing
on the first day of snow?

1051
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:31,457
What? When's that?

1052
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:37,668
Well, I'm not sure...

1053
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:42,969
When winter comes?

1054
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,672
Do you wanna meet up?

1055
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,385
Soundsfun

1056
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:51,685
Let's meet

1057
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:55,607
in the empty house
on the first day it snows

1058
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,024
Okay?

1059
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,112
Well, okay

1060
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,860
Promise!

1061
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,284
I'm Mr.Yang Sang-yun's daughter

1062
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:53,782
He suddenly had blood pressure
problems and got worse

1063
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,992
Is he okay now?

1064
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:59,204
He's stabilized for now

1065
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:03,541
Well have to wait for
the CT scan results tomorrow

1066
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,369
- Hello
- Hi

1067
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,791
You came?

1068
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,464
What are you doing?

1069
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,803
Errands

1070
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,718
I love the basalt in the yard

1071
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,470
Can we put more in?

1072
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:56,936
It's perfect as is. No more

1073
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,604
Let's just eat

1074
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:04,937
PIANO SCHOOL

1075
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,942
Know this place?

1076
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:14,154
I started taking piano here

1077
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,114
It's still the same

1078
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,414
Let's go eat. Aren't you hungry?

1079
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,380
Why're you dying to eat?

1080
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,332
Starve yourself?

1081
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,300
I wanna buy you seaweed soup

1082
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,966
For what?

1083
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:34,515
For your birthday
It's November 11th, isn't it?

1084
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,310
What?

1085
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,310
I'm wrong?

1086
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,391
Did you change your birthday?

1087
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,318
No. It's my birthday

1088
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,111
Then, what?

1089
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,202
Cuz you're cute and sweet

1090
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,953
Where's my present?

1091
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,075
This is it?

1092
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,332
Sea urchin in seaweed tastes really good

1093
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,833
There's something I want

1094
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:09,508
I've never tasted anything like this

1095
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,468
Can I say it?

1096
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,888
What is it this time?

1097
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:21,054
I need a room for a piano

1098
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,687
I gave it a lot of thought

1099
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,691
I'm going to settle down here

1100
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,610
My dad

1101
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,321
The hospital can't do much for him now

1102
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,293
He has 1 or 2 years left

1103
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,248
It's not a long time

1104
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:51,217
Spending that time with him

1105
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,887
I think it'll be good

1106
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,220
So, I won't regret it

1107
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:08,150
And I wanna take the time
to reset my life

1108
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,484
Start fresh. Cool, huh?

1109
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,279
For real?

1110
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,861
Yes

1111
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,787
Are you crazy?

1112
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,082
I don't get that woman!

1113
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,456
It's going to be done next week!

1114
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,704
Is she kidding?

1115
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,584
She says shell pay
all additional costs

1116
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,290
Money's not everything

1117
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:35,344
It'll take a month to redesign it

1118
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,838
What about our schedule?

1119
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,340
Next months our wedding!

1120
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,842
I told you

1121
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,184
She wants to settle there

1122
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,603
That's her problem!

1123
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,818
I won't do it

1124
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,521
I can't

1125
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,816
Just hand it over to me

1126
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,243
You get ready for the wedding

1127
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,532
No, I'll do it

1128
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,950
I'll finish it

1129
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,785
Let me do this

1130
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,342
We can't expand it any bigger by law

1131
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,679
So, let's put the piano here

1132
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,381
What about my room?

1133
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,393
We'll put it upstairs

1134
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:27,392
Make it into a two-story house

1135
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,059
You'll get hurt

1136
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,689
Don't worry, I won't

1137
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,613
I'm scared of getting hurt cuz of you

1138
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,487
The depth should be 30cm

1139
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:42,194
for enough light to come in

1140
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,155
It has to look good

1141
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,498
so please be extra careful with this

1142
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,918
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you!

1143
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,506
Wanna go around again?

1144
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,890
I meant 150 with the finishings

1145
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,436
We gotta do it again

1146
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,114
The movers are coming on the 28th

1147
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,908
<i>E verythings going b y boat so its crazy</i>

1148
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,908
Take things slowly

1149
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,904
Thanks for listening to
my boring lectures all semester

1150
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,323
Feel more familiar with architecture now?

1151
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,900
- Yes
- Class is over

1152
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,326
There's an after-party

1153
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,280
Hope you all stop by for drinks

1154
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,622
Dismissed!

1155
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,467
Jae-wook?

1156
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,349
I heard you moved

1157
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,975
Not too long ago

1158
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,769
Then, let's stop by the party

1159
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,316
and I'll drive you home

1160
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:49,525
But have you seen Seung-min today?

1161
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,074
Seung-min? No

1162
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,784
I can't be friends anymore

1163
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:04,044
My mind, my heart won't allow...

1164
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:07,251
Damn!

1165
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,684
It's freezing

1166
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:41,869
I like you

1167
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,885
That's it

1168
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,390
Where are you?

1169
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,763
Why aren't you answering?

1170
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:02,310
Page me when you hear this Okay?

1171
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,146
Recorded

1172
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,152
What are you doing here?

1173
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,863
Nothing

1174
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:14,943
Here

1175
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,074
But I can't really drink

1176
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,000
Me, neither

1177
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:48,106
Seo-yeun? Are you okay?

1178
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,906
We're here

1179
01:25:54,066 --> 01:26:00,915
Seo-yeun? Can you walk?

1180
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,125
Seo-yeun?

1181
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,959
You Okay?

1182
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:07,958
Seo-yeun?

1183
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,200
Let's go in first

1184
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,786
Is this it?

1185
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,005
Down here?

1186
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:53,341
Careful

1187
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:56,446
Where're you headed?

1188
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,367
Huh?

1189
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,867
Jeongneung

1190
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,040
I can't go there

1191
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,417
WW not?

1192
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:17,168
I can't go north of the river
at this hour

1193
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,680
Let's go

1194
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,973
No, I can't

1195
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,101
Close the door

1196
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,974
Go to Jeongneung

1197
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,897
Close the door

1198
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,694
- Fuck! Let's go!
- Fuck?

1199
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:39,739
Crazy little bastard

1200
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,319
What did you just say? Fuck?

1201
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:48,282
Go home quietly if you're drunk kid

1202
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,625
Go to Jeongneung!

1203
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,250
Get away!

1204
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:55,751
Go to Jeongneung!

1205
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,585
- Son of a bitch!
- Go to Jeongneung!

1206
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:03,009
Who'd go that far at this hour!

1207
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,136
Crazy son of a bitch!

1208
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:06,558
Go to Jeongneung!

1209
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:09,853
Why you little!

1210
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,896
Get away!

1211
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,650
That bitch!

1212
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,777
That stupid bitch!

1213
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,658
Forget her

1214
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,701
She's not the only girl

1215
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,203
Forget a bitch like that!

1216
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,922
When I go to college next year

1217
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:40,001
I'll look after ya

1218
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,763
But

1219
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,054
Just cuz they went in together

1220
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,353
that doesn't mean anything happened

1221
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:55,474
He could've just took her home

1222
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:58,602
cuz she's drunk

1223
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,826
I'll bring Flurry and Faze over

1224
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:13,037
We'll meet on the first day of snow

1225
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,871
And have a double date

1226
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:19,965
We'll have snowball fights

1227
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,667
and make snowmen

1228
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,879
Slapping wrists, too!

1229
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:31,185
Doesn't that sound awesome?
Seung-min?

1230
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,551
Cheer up, pal

1231
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,451
This way, please

1232
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,497
You're here?

1233
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,293
All done

1234
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,300
When are you completely
moving down here?

1235
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:01,728
As soon as Dad gets out of
the hospital

1236
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,879
It's all finished, huh?

1237
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,167
All over

1238
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,968
How do you feel?

1239
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:37,673
It was good to build this

1240
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,179
I'm glad I did it

1241
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,180
And you?

1242
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,516
How do you feel?

1243
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:51,693
Not sure

1244
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:54,318
You didn't like it?

1245
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,658
You made a promise
to build my house

1246
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,255
Remember?

1247
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,692
Tell me

1248
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,191
Why were you so nice to me then?

1249
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:39,992
Because I liked you

1250
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,126
Now, you tell me?

1251
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,332
It took long enough

1252
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,878
You knew?

1253
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,805
Think I'm stupid?
Of course I knew

1254
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:07,350
You even kissed me

1255
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,148
When I was asleep

1256
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,773
That was my first kiss

1257
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,716
It's late. I'd better go

1258
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,015
OKHY

1259
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,315
Take care

1260
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:54,892
Bye

1261
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,029
Want me to move this?

1262
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:02,363
No, I'll do it later

1263
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,951
It's not much

1264
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,244
Where do you want it?

1265
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,539
It's okay. I'll do it

1266
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:32,021
Why'd you come to me?

1267
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:37,318
Anyone could've built your house

1268
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:44,193
Why'd you come to me now?

1269
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,290
I was curious

1270
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,292
What?

1271
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:56,121
How you're living

1272
01:37:58,164 --> 01:37:59,916
How you are now

1273
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:03,424
I was curious

1274
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,463
That's it?

1275
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:08,265
Just cuz you're curious?

1276
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,844
That's why you had this all this time?

1277
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:14,062
Yes

1278
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,608
That's why I had it

1279
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,896
Why can't I hold on to it?

1280
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,200
When you're...

1281
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,038
You were my first love

1282
01:39:38,264 --> 01:39:41,814
I called many times

1283
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,396
But you never answered

1284
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:16,052
I don't have a CD player

1285
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,433
I can't listen to it

1286
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,650
And don't call me anymore

1287
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,286
Why?

1288
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:36,280
Just don't

1289
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,372
What do you mean?

1290
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:56,514
Now...Get out of my life

1291
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:21,542
- How's this?
- Hmm?

1292
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,586
This is better, isn't it?

1293
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,173
I think it's better, too

1294
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:33,881
I must've gained weight.
It feels tight

1295
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:38,309
Doesn't it look too racy?

1296
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,605
It's suffocating

1297
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:50,029
Suffocating? Where?

1298
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:53,775
It's so stuffy I feel like

1299
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:56,618
I'm going to die

1300
01:41:57,486 --> 01:42:00,114
How can I help you?

1301
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,199
Wanna go for a walk?

1302
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:07,330
- I want to go home
- What?

1303
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:12,631
I want to go home

1304
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:25,186
Okay, let's go home Dad

1305
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:27,976
It's all built

1306
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:30,482
We can go and live there

1307
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,900
Wanna see pictures?

1308
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:43,783
This is the living room

1309
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:45,868
and the master bedroom

1310
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:47,836
And here...

1311
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,502
Who's this?

1312
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,518
He's just

1313
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,224
A friend

1314
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,440
Pork Soup?

1315
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,278
For old time sake

1316
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:23,872
You can't eat that in the States

1317
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:29,086
Should I just stay, Mom?

1318
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:31,789
What the hell are you saying?

1319
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:35,377
You'll be alone. I'm worried

1320
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:39,805
Shut up and cut the nonsense

1321
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,427
Fool

1322
01:43:48,848 --> 01:43:50,020
Here

1323
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:54,486
It's my wedding gift. Use it

1324
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:56,064
That's for selling your shop

1325
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:58,570
Move to an apartment with it!

1326
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:00,777
Live comfortably for once!

1327
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,613
I forgot the Kimchi

1328
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,744
Where's my head?

1329
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,535
Don't worry about me

1330
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:10,836
Just be good to your wife

1331
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:16,046
Not again

1332
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:23,053
I lived here for over 30 years

1333
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:30,436
Expect me to go someplace new
at my age?

1334
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:34,152
I'm gonna live here till I die

1335
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:35,986
Don't say that!

1336
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:37,938
You're not gonna die

1337
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:40,942
If you get old, you die

1338
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,073
Aren't you sick of this place?

1339
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:45,371
You struggled your whole life here

1340
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:48,950
Why would I be sick of it?

1341
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:51,661
A home is a home

1342
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:59,506
Why's it so hard to open?

1343
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,822
- I'm gonna take a nap
- Okay

1344
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:32,385
You're playing a little fast

1345
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:37,391
Let's practice it 10 more times

1346
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:40,018
- Okay
- Ready?

1347
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:45,815
Have a good day

1348
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:48,613
- See you tomorrow
- Bye

1349
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:54,738
Dad, let's go in. It's cold

1350
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,822
It's okay

1351
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:58,782
I love this

1352
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:14,469
Anyone home?

1353
